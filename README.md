## 🎯 What is Kaleidoscope?

Kaleidoscope is a multi-device preview tool designed for developers using Claude Code who need to validate responsive designs across 8 different device sizes before deploying. It combines:

- **Multi-device preview**: View websites on iPhone, iPad, Desktop simultaneously
- **Localhost support**: Preview your local dev server (`http://localhost:3000`)
- **Auth preview**: Test authenticated pages with cookie injection
- **Interactive flow diagrams**: Map user journeys and test entire flows
- **MCP integration**: Claude can programmatically invoke previews

## ✨ Features

- 📱 8 device types (Mobile, Tablet, Desktop)
- 🔥 Live reload when files change
- 🔐 Authentication support
- 🔄 URL tunneling for web Claude Code users
- 📸 Screenshots (Basic & HD)
- 🔍 Flow diagram search & spotlight
- ⌨️ Keyboard navigation
- 🌙 Dark mode

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm or pnpm
- (Optional) Docker for containerized setup

### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended for Development)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Kaleidoscope.git
cd Kaleidoscope

# 2. Install dependencies
npm run install:all

# 3. Start development servers
npm run dev:all
```

This starts:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000

### Option 2: Docker (Easiest)

```bash
# Start everything with Docker Compose
docker-compose up

# Access Kaleidoscope at http://localhost:5173
```

## 📖 How to Use

### Basic Preview

1. Open Kaleidoscope: http://localhost:5173
2. In the sidebar, enter a URL: `https://example.com`
3. Press Enter or click the arrow button
4. See your site on 8 different devices!

### Preview Your Local Development Server

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start your dev server
cd your-project
npm run dev
# Running on http://localhost:3000

# Terminal 2: Already running Kaleidoscope
# Just enter: http://localhost:3000 in Kaleidoscope
```

**Note**: Localhost URLs now work! Previously blocked, this has been fixed in the latest version.

### Test With Sample Projects

We include sample projects for testing:

```bash
# Start sample site (port 3000)
cd examples/sample-site
npm install
npm run dev

# Start auth demo (port 3001)
cd examples/auth-demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then preview:
- Sample site: `http://localhost:3000`
- Auth demo: `http://localhost:3001`

### Preview Authenticated Pages

Some pages require login (e.g., dashboards). Here's how to preview them:

1. **Start the auth demo**:
   ```bash
   cd examples/auth-demo
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Log in normally** in a new tab:
   - Go to http://localhost:3001/login
   - Username: `demo`, Password: `demo`
   - You'll be redirected to the dashboard

3. **Get your session cookie**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application → Cookies
   - Find `session_token`
   - Copy the value: `demo_session_abc123`

4. **In Kaleidoscope**:
   - Enter URL: `http://localhost:3001/dashboard`
   - Click "Preview with Auth" (coming in next update)
   - Paste cookie name: `session_token`
   - Paste cookie value: `demo_session_abc123`
   - All devices now show the logged-in dashboard!

## 🤖 MCP Server (Claude Code Integration)

Kaleidoscope includes an MCP server that lets Claude Code control previews and screenshots programmatically.

### Setup

Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "kaleidoscope": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["tsx", "src/index.ts"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/Kaleidoscope/mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `preview_responsive` | Open a URL for responsive preview across device sizes |
| `capture_screenshots` | Capture screenshots across multiple viewports |
| `kaleidoscope_status` | Check if services are running |
| `kaleidoscope_start` | Start Kaleidoscope services |
| `kaleidoscope_stop` | Stop all services |

### Example Usage (in Claude Code)

```
"Preview my app at localhost:3000 across all mobile devices"
→ Calls preview_responsive(url="http://localhost:3000", devices=["iphone-14","samsung-s21","pixel-6"])

"Take screenshots of my dashboard on desktop and iPad"
→ Calls capture_screenshots(url="http://localhost:3000/dashboard", devices=["desktop","ipad"])
```

## 📸 Screenshots

Capture device screenshots via the sidebar panel or the Screenshot button in the toolbar.

- Select which device viewports to capture
- Toggle full-page capture for scrollable content
- Screenshots are saved to `./screenshots/` as PNG files
- Powered by Playwright + Chromium for pixel-perfect results

### Screenshot API

```bash
# Capture screenshots via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/screenshots \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url":"http://localhost:3000","devices":["iphone-14","desktop"]}'
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Unit Tests (Vitest)

```bash
cd mosaic-client
npm run test

# With UI
npm run test:ui

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### E2E Tests (Playwright)

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test:e2e

# Interactive mode
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium
```

### Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 19 + TypeScript
- Vite 7 (build tool)
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components
- React Query (data fetching)
- Vitest (testing)

**Backend:**
- Express.js
- TypeScript
- esbuild (bundler)

**Testing:**
- Vitest (unit tests)
- Playwright (E2E tests)
- React Testing Library

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to localhost:3000"

**Problem**: Kaleidoscope can't reach your dev server.

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure your dev server is running: `npm run dev` in your project
2. Check the port number matches
3. Try http://127.0.0.1:3000 instead of localhost

### "Refused to display in a frame"

**Problem**: Website has `X-Frame-Options: DENY` header.

**Explanation**: Some sites (Google, Facebook) block embedding for security.

**Solutions**:
- This is expected behavior for those sites
- Your own localhost sites won't have this restriction
- For production sites, you can't bypass this (it's a security feature)

### "High memory usage"

**Problem**: Browser using too much RAM with 8 iframes.

**Solutions**:
- Close some device previews
- Use single device mode instead of comparison
- Reduce number of pinned devices
- Restart browser

### Tests Failing

**Problem**: E2E tests fail to connect.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers
npx playwright install

# Make sure servers are running
npm run dev:all

# Run tests again
npm test
```
